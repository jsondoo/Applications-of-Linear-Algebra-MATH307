# Applications Of Linear Algebra (MATH307 2016W T2)
Topics Covered
* Lagrange interpolation
* Cubic spline interpolation
* Finite differences to solve second order differential equations
* Graphs
* Circuit systems
* Fourier series
* Modelling using MATLAB

Questions that I found fascinating are posted here. MATLAB was to work with large matrices and plot solutions. All solutions were written by me.
