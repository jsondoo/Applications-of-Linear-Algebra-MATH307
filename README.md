# MATH307 - Applicatoins Of Linear Algebra
Applications of linear algebra. Topics include: Lagrange and cubic spline interpolation, finite differences, graphs, circuit systems, fourier series, etc.

Questions that I found fascinating are posted here. MATLAB was to work with large matrices and plot solutions. All solutions were written by me.
