# Applications Of Linear Algebra (MATH307 2016W T2)
Topics:
* Lagrange interpolation
* Cubic spline interpolation
* Finite differences to solve second order differential equations
* Graphs
* Circuit systems
* Fourier series
* Modelling using MATLAB
* and more...

Questions and solutions (MATLAB code and plots) that I find fascinating are posted here. 
All solutions are written by me.
